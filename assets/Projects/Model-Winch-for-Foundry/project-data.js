  <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
  <p>A foundry crucible needs to be lifted by a winch at a speed that's neither too fast nor too
  slow: too fast, and the molten metal inside sloshes around, a major safety hazard; too slow,
  and the metal solidifies and fuses to the crucible, ruining it. The task is to design a gearbox
  and shaft system that takes a high-speed motor (11000rpm, 2.1W) and reliably reduces
  it to lift a 1kg mass 120cm within a strict 10-20 second window, while fitting inside a
  200x200mm housing, using an 8mm shaft, and staying within a 250Dhs budget.</p>
